# CS279r HW: Todo App in Svelte/Meteor

This code creates a basic to-do list web app using Meteor/Svelte. In addition to the basic functionality of adding and checking off todos, it also allows users to delete todos entirely, displays a counter of the number of incomplete todos, and has a filtering function. 

## Usage

Access the app at [this link](https://svelte-meteor-todolist.meteorapp.com/).

Alternatively, clone this repository (from the command line or using GitHub Desktop). If from the command line, use the following command:

git clone https://github.com/19katz/simple-todos-svelte.git

Once cloned locally, install meteor using `npm install -g meteor`. Then, navigate to the folder and run `meteor run`. 

Then, navigate to the localhost link given on the terminal console. Ensure that Meteor and Node are installed before going to the link, or it will not work.
